    <p>Mon Laferte is not just that Chilean singer recognizable by her tattoos, her raven hair (now dyed in the
        fashionable copper), her characteristic cat eye and pin-up style. Mon Laferte is much more. All the more so,
        that at the same pace as she discovers herself and sheds new layers, she gives us direct access to her feelings and thoughts with each of her songs. In 'SEIS', their most recent album, we can hear it. His speaker not only projects songs of love and heartbreak, with that particular heartbreaking voice, he is also not censored as an LGTBQ+ activist and makes anthems for the feminist struggle and the Chilean political struggle. She stands by her convictions and is not willing, as she has stated on other occasions, to apologize or ask for permission for being a woman. For several years he has lived in Mexico, but it is clear that his ties with Chile have never faded. Even less is her closeness, honesty and self-confidence to talk about her humble origins in a neighborhood of Vi√±a del Mar, of only having been raised by her mother and grandmother, or of arriving on a red carpet and opening her dress, letting He looked at her breasts, so that the world could read the message he recorded on them: 'In Chile they torture, rape and kill.' Lik everyone, she accumulates detractors and many followers, and her career continues to grow, evolving between that alloy of pop, rock, cumbia, bolero, ska and other genres that make her, among many other things, a full-fledged Latin American artist.
